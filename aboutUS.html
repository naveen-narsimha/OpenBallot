                India is a nation formed by the people, of the people and for the people, but
                the people are not aware of how government activities are proceeding and this
                majorly affecting their choice of electing a right candidate for election. We are
                going to propose a decentralised, immutable records of all the developmental
                activities accomplished by the representatives (MLA/MP) in their local
                development division area. All the people have access to these records and
                could review the developmental activities of representatives in their division
                area.
                The revenue generated from the taxes of people will not go in vein and serve
                the right purpose. This system brings transparency in the governance to some
                extent and more respect about the representatives for their work.
                Leading to improvement in quality of living of people of India and attain the
                sustainability in all respect.
                A good governance will attract the foreign investment and finally supporting
                startups and helps in reducing the unemployability. This solution also through
                a light on the corruption free nation
